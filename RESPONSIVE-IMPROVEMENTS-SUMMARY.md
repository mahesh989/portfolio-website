## 💡 Pro Tips

2. **Use the testing tool** - Run `responsive-test.html` regularly
3. **Check mobile analytics** - See what devices your users actually use
4. **Update regularly** - New devices and browsers release constantly
5. **Performance matters** - Fast sites rank better and convert better
6. **Accessibility is not optional** - Makes your site usable for everyone

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Horizontal scrolling on mobile
**Solution**: 
1. Open browser DevTools
2. Add temporary CSS: `* { outline: 1px solid red; }`
3. Find the overflowing element
4. Add `max-width: 100%` or adjust width

### Issue: Text too small on iOS
**Solution**: Ensure minimum 16px font size on inputs to prevent zoom

### Issue: Layout breaks at specific width
**Solution**: Check breakpoint transitions in `responsive-enhanced.css`

### Issue: Touch targets too small
**Solution**: Verify minimum 44x44px in DevTools, increase padding if needed

### Issue: Content cut off on iPhone X/11/12/13/14
**Solution**: Ensure `viewport-fit=cover` in meta tag and safe area insets in CSS
